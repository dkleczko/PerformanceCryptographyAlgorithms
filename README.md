# Performance of cryptography algorithms 

The application was created for the purposes of research for master's thesis. The main goal was to check performance selected cryptography algorithms in .Net Framework. The second goal was to analyze the time efficiency of the XOR algorithm using parallel programming.

## Getting Started

It is simple console application with text menu. The only thing you have to do is build project via Visual Studio or MSBuild and run .exe file.

### Prerequisites

```
- .Net Framework 4.5
```
